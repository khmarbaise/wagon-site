Integration Testing with Maven

* Overview

  If you already familiar with {{{http://maven.apache.org}Maven}} you
  know {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html}where to put your unit tests}}
  but unfortunately currently there does not exist a definition like
  this for integration tests. There are some suggestions circulating around
  like <<<src/test/it>>>, but these are only rumors.

  In this guide we suggest to put them into the same directory structure
  like the unit tests which means in other words <<<src/test/java>>> and
  make them distinguishable by the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin/integration-test-mojo.html#includes}naming conventions}},
  but in future Maven releases this might be changed.

~~ Integration Tests have a more comprehensive character than unit tests.

  The execution of integration tests is handled by the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin/}Maven Failsafe Plugin}}.


  * In Module Integration Test Examples

    * {{{./it-example.html}Integration test example}}

    * {{{./it-example-1.html}Different location of the integration test classes.}}

  * Simple integration test example (CLI Example in module)

  * separate module for integration tests.

  * IT example separate module...

  * Complex examples
    
    Integration Test of a Implementaiton against an Interface 
    with at least two implementations; Injection for example via
    guice.

  *** Integration test of a web app (war + tomcat?)

  * Plugin Development integration tests
