Integration Test Example Container

  This example will describe how to do an integration-test with
  a web application which will be deployed to a servlet container
  like Tomcat.

  We use the {{{http://cargo.codehaus.org/Home}CARGO}} to do the 
  integration test of a web application.

  By the help of Cargo it's possible to do the startup of a container,
  deploy the web application (war) start the container and run the 
  integration tests and finally stop the container.

  {{{http://cargo.codehaus.org/Home#Home-ContainerSupport}Cargo supports a large number of containers}}
  which can be used either via the {{{http://cargo.codehaus.org/Javadocs}Java API}}
  or in our case via the {{{http://cargo.codehaus.org/Maven2+plugin}Maven 2/3 Plugin}}.
