How to do Integration Test with Interfaces

  This is a starting point.
  Based on the earlier examples (...unit test interfaces)..
  A typical situation within a project is that you created an interface and
  have a number of implementations. Concluding the former idea the structure
  of the project follows:

+--------
.
|-- interface-impl-a
|   |-- pom.xml
|   ...
|-- interface-impl-b
|   |-- pom.xml
|   ...
|-- interface-interface
|   |-- pom.xml
|   ...
|-- interface-test
|   |-- pom.xml
|   ...
`-- pom.xml
+--------
