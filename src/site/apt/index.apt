Overview

  This is the <The Maven Unit and Integration Test Guide> (MaUI Test Guide) which
  describes the different options how to do unit- and integration testing with 
  {{{http://maven.apache.org}Maven}} in different situations. For example if
  you are writing a Maven Plugin or just developing different other modules.

  This is no plugin or development project is is just a guide how to unit 
  and or integration tests in relationship with {{{http://maven.apache.org}Maven}}.

* Prerequisites

  This guides requires that you already know Maven and it's
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html}life-cycles}}
  etc. It will not explain how to configure a Maven Plugin etc.

  If you don't know {{{http://maven.apache.org}Maven}} or it's basic usage i recommend you to read
  {{{http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/public-book.html}Maven: The Complete Reference}}
  or
  {{{http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnex-book/reference/public-book.html}Maven by Example}} or
  other sources.

* Definition of Terms

  We distinguish between a so called <in Module> integration tests and a <separated module> integration tests.
  The <in module> means to have the integration tests within the same module which contains the unit tests and
  your production code <<<src/main/java>>>. This approach is usually used if you have only a single module.

  The <separated module> integration is mostly used if you have already a multiple module build. The result will
  be to have a supplemental module which contains the integration tests only.

* Overview

  This guide is separated into three chapters where the first is about
  {{{./overview-unit-test.html}Unit Testing with Maven}}, the second about
  {{{./overview-integration-test.html}Integration Testing with Maven}} and
  the last one is {{{./overview-mp-it.html}Maven Plugin Integration Testing}}.
