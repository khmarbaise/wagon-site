Running Integration Tests Multiple Times.

  In rare cases you may need to run you integration tests multiple times with
  different parameters.
  This can be achieved by using the <<<executions>>> sections in the pom.xml and
  configure the {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin/}Maven Failsafe Plugin}}
  appropriately.

  An example for such scenario could be if you are testing a DAO back-end which is
  done with MySQL but you want to test with Oracle as well.
